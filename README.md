# Pupal_respirometry

This repo contains scripts for the analysis of the pupal diapaause 
respirometry analysis in Calvert et al. (2019). Once, the article has been 
accepted, I will also add or provide a link for the data itself.

The goal of this analysis was to respirometrically characterize diapause 
classes in *Rhagoletis pomonella* and determine if the frequency of those 
classes differed between the apple and hawthorn host races. 

This repo contains a single R script for both the analysis and the 
figures. It also contains a figure that was generated from this analysis plus
a little tinkering in Adobe Illustrator
